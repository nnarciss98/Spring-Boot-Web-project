# Spring-Boot-Web-project
---

Project where I'll be exerimenting with Spring Boot Web capabilities and testing out what it can do, learning as I go through it.

I will explain more clearly what I did here and why the annotations where used in those places, what their role is and how they interact with each other.

But, as for now I will first finish it completely, then I'll go through it and make a full description of the project.
